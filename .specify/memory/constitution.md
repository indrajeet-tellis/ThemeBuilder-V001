## Core Principles

### I. AI-First Component Architecture
Every component must be designed for AI agent consumption and manipulation. Components are self-contained, independently deployable units with comprehensive metadata. The component registry is the single source of truth for AI decision-making, containing all necessary information for selection, customization, and deployment. No component exists without proper registry documentation and AI integration points.

### II. Performance-First Design
All components must achieve Lighthouse scores above 90 on mobile and desktop. Performance is not optional; it's a core requirement. Components must be optimized for bundle size, runtime performance, and loading speed. Image optimization, lazy loading, and code splitting are mandatory considerations, not afterthoughts. Performance budgets must be established and enforced for all component additions.

### III. Type Safety & Validation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
TypeScript strict mode is mandatory throughout the codebase. Zod validation schemas must accompany all components and data structures. No dynamic data processing without proper type validation. Runtime type safety ensures AI agent reliability and prevents deployment failures. All component props must be fully typed with comprehensive documentation.

### IV. Theme & Customization System
Every component must support multiple themes and customization options. Themes are not skin-deep; they are comprehensive design systems that can be applied at runtime. The theme system must support AI-driven customization while maintaining design consistency. Components must be flexible enough to accommodate AI-generated content while preserving accessibility and performance.

### V. Comprehensive Testing Discipline
Unit tests with Vitest and integration tests with React Testing Library are mandatory for all components. Visual regression testing with Storybook ensures UI consistency. Accessibility testing with Axe Core guarantees WCAG compliance. Performance testing validates speed requirements. No component can be merged without passing all test categories and achieving 95%+ coverage.

## Technology Standards

Technology choices are intentional and optimized for AI agent workflows. Next.js 15 with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Zod, and Zustand form the core stack. No arbitrary technology additions; each tool must serve a specific purpose in the AI-driven website generation workflow. Modern build tools like Turborepo and Biome ensure fast development cycles and consistent code quality. All dependencies must be justified and documented in the context of AI agent integration.

## Development Workflow

All development follows a strict AI-first workflow. Components are designed with AI agent consumption as the primary use case. Code reviews focus on AI integration points, performance implications, and type safety. Automated quality gates enforce constitution compliance. Continuous integration validates all aspects: performance, accessibility, testing coverage, and AI integration readiness. No component is considered complete until it can be successfully used by an AI agent to generate a website section.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all development practices and technical decisions. Amendments require formal documentation, team approval, and a migration plan for existing components. All pull requests and code reviews must verify constitutional compliance. Technical complexity must be justified in the context of AI agent efficiency. Component additions must prove value in the AI-driven website generation workflow. Use the implementation plan and specification documents as runtime development guidance.
