# Feature Specification: Frontend Master Branch Component Library

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-want-to`
**Created**: 2025-01-08
**Status**: Ready for Planning
**Input**: User description: "I want to only build the fronted master branch project which will have multiple themes, pages, sections , componets in a structred way according to our requirement so that AI can copy and create a new website according to customer choice."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - AI-Powered Website Generation (Priority: P1)

AI agents need to select and copy components from a master branch to create customized salon websites based on customer requirements and business information.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that enables the entire Rebrand.Salon platform to function. Without a well-structured component library, the AI cannot efficiently generate websites.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having an AI agent successfully navigate the component library, select appropriate components for a given salon category, and generate a complete website structure.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a salon business in the hair category, **When** the AI agent accesses the component library, **Then** it can identify and select hair salon-specific themes, pages, and components
2. **Given** a customer's color preferences, **When** the AI generates a website, **Then** it can apply the selected color palette to the copied components
3. **Given** business information (name, address, services), **When** the AI populates the website, **Then** all components display the correct business data

---

### User Story 2 - Component Reusability and Maintenance (Priority: P2)

Developers need to maintain and update the master branch component library to ensure all generated websites benefit from improvements and new features.

**Why this priority**: Essential for long-term platform sustainability and ensuring consistent quality across all generated websites.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by making changes to components in the master branch and verifying that existing websites remain functional while new websites get the updated components.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a component update in the master branch, **When** a new website is generated, **Then** it uses the updated component version
2. **Given** a new component is added to the library, **When** the AI agent analyzes available options, **Then** the new component is available for selection
3. **Given** a bug fix in a core component, **When** the fix is applied to master, **Then** all future websites include the fix without breaking existing functionality

---

### User Story 3 - Theme and Page Customization (Priority: P2)

AI agents need to be able to customize themes and pages by selecting different layouts, sections, and components based on individual customer needs.

**Why this priority**: Enables personalization and differentiation between websites while maintaining design consistency.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by having the AI generate multiple websites for the same business type with different themes and configurations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple theme options for hair salons, **When** an AI agent generates websites, **Then** each can have a distinct visual style while maintaining functionality
2. **Given** different page requirements, **When** the AI configures a website, **Then** it can include or exclude specific pages based on customer needs
3. **Given** various section layouts, **When** the AI builds a page, **Then** it can arrange components in different configurations while maintaining responsiveness

---

### User Story 4 - Performance Optimization (Priority: P3)

The component library must be optimized for performance to ensure generated websites load quickly and provide good user experience.

**Why this priority**: Performance impacts user satisfaction, SEO rankings, and overall platform success.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by measuring load times and performance metrics of generated websites.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a generated website, **When** performance is tested, **Then** it achieves Google PageSpeed scores above 90 on both mobile and desktop
2. **Given** multiple components on a page, **When** the page loads, **Then** all resources are optimized and load efficiently
3. **Given** image assets in components, **When** the website is generated, **Then** all images are properly optimized and served via CDN

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a required component dependency is missing from the master branch?
- How does the system handle conflicts between component versions?
- What occurs when a customer requests customization beyond available component options?
- How are breaking changes in components managed for existing websites?
- What happens when the AI agent selects incompatible components together?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
